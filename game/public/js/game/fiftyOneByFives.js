// Rules of Play:
// The total points for each turn must be divisible by five to receive any score.
// The score for each turn is determined by the number of fives hit.
// For example, if a player gets 20 points on a turn, the score is 4
//     because 20 divided by 5 is 4. If a score for an entire turn is not
//     divisible by 5, it is not counted.
// All numbers on the board are used, including triples, doubles and bulls.
// The winner is the first player to score fifty-one fives and all three darts
//     must score on the last turn.
